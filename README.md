- 👋 Hi, I’m @pacegu52
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the fundamentals of Data Science and eventually working in this branch. I have a basic knowledge of Statistics and I'm interested in learning to program.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and R programs, and look forward to learning SQL too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I can develop what I learn in This Coursera program.
- 📫 How to reach me. It can be through E-mail: pcg520207@hotmail.com or via Facebook and Messenger. My page is my whole name: Pablo Ceballos Guevara, as it is also for Twitter (now X).
- 😄 Pronouns: I don't understand this. Is it how I should be called? I'm a man, so it could be 'Mr.' for formal communication.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Neither this one. What do I like to do? Best, I like to take strolls and navigate the internet.
